As a **BI Consultant**, my objective was to analyze **Plato's Pizza's** sales data and uncover insights to improve business operations. I used **Power BI** to clean, transform, and visualize data, creating an **interactive dashboard** that highlights key performance indicators, sales trends, and customer behavior. This project helps stakeholders make **data-driven decisions** to optimize revenue and operational efficiency.

## **Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard Creation**  
Using **Power BI**, I developed a **single-page dashboard** that provides valuable insights, including:  

âœ… **KPIs** for **daily revenue, order volume, and total sales**  
âœ… **Monthly sales & order trends** through line charts  
âœ… **Heatmap analysis** for busiest sales hours during the week  
âœ… **Category & size breakdown** using **donut charts and bar graphs**  
âœ… **Top & least-performing pizzas** for strategic menu decisions  
âœ… **Word cloud visualization** to highlight popular ingredients  

The dashboard allows stakeholders to **explore trends, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance business performance**.

## **Insights and Recommendations**  

### ðŸ“Œ Sales Trends  
- **July sees peak sales and revenue**, likely due to summer activities.  
- **Sales drop in September-October**, possibly due to the back-to-school season.  
- **November sales rise**, likely due to holiday preparations.  

âœ… **Recommendation:**  
Adjust promotions to **leverage summer peaks**, offer **back-to-school discounts**, and introduce **holiday specials** in November.  

### ðŸ“Œ Peak Sales Hours  
- **Lunchtime (12:00 - 13:00)** and **evening (17:00 - 18:00)** are the busiest periods.  

âœ… **Recommendation:**  
Allocate **additional labor** during peak hours to meet demand efficiently.  

### ðŸ“Œ Menu & Stock Optimization  
- **Classic pizzas generate the highest revenue** â€“ prioritize marketing efforts for this category.  
- **Large-size pizzas are in high demand** â€“ increase inventory accordingly.  
- **Classic Deluxe pizza is a bestseller** â€“ promote it further to boost revenue.  
- **Brie Carre pizza has low demand** â€“ consider revising or removing it from the menu.
