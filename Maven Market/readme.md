# 📊 Maven Market Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📁 About This Project

As a **Business Intelligence Analyst**, my objective was to analyze Maven Market's sales data and provide actionable insights that drive performance across products, regions, stores, and customer segments.

Using **Power BI**, I cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to build a **multi-page interactive dashboard**. This project empowers stakeholders to monitor performance, uncover trends, and make strategic decisions.
