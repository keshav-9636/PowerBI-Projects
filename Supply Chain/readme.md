**Tools Used**: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling  
**Context**: Codebasics Resume Project Challenge (FMCG Industry)

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Atliq Mart was facing a business-critical challenge: key customers were not renewing contracts.  
Internal stakeholder discussions revealed the root cause — lack of visibility into key **service-level KPIs** such as:

- **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**

Business leaders needed a **centralized dashboard** to monitor these KPIs across **cities, customers, and product categories** to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

---

## 🧠 Solution

I developed an interactive and visually engaging **Power BI dashboard** that enables stakeholders to:

✅ Monitor OT, IF, and OTIF against targets  
✅ Drill down by **city**, **customer**, and **time** (monthly, weekly, daily)  
✅ Track **Line Fill Rate (LIFR)** and **Volume Fill Rate (VOFR)**  
✅ Switch between KPIs dynamically using slicers  
✅ Use **matrix visuals**, **conditional formatting**, and **sparklines** for quick pattern recognition  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **OTIF** was just **29.02%** (Target: 65.91%) — a significant performance gap  
- **Surat** topped in On-Time delivery (61.21%), but still missed OTIF targets  
- Matrix views helped spotlight underperforming customers with <30% OTIF  
- **Milk 250ml & 100ml** emerged as top-selling products by volume  
- **LIFR** was only **65.96%** despite a high **VOFR** of **96.59%**  
- **Cycle Time** exceeded the 2-day target, delaying deliveries

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Created a **single source of truth** for weekly/monthly business reviews  
- Helped supply chain leadership **identify service gaps** and **prioritize interventions**  
- Replaced manual reporting with a **dynamic, drillable dashboard**  
- Facilitated **data-driven decision-making** at city, customer, and product levels
